[](#aboutme)
I am a Master student from the [School of Transportation Science and Engineering](https://transportation.buaa.edu.cn/), [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/). I am working in the VCI lab, and supervised by Kevin Deng.

My research interests include autonomous vehicle (AV), decesion-making, trajectory planning and control. I am particularly interested in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in autonomous driving algorithms.

I received the B.E. degree from the Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing, China, in 2021.

**Research Interest:** autonomous driving, trajectory planning, vehicle dynamics and control.
